- The way TeX Live is distributed by XBPS has changed. Native binaries
  for your architecture are installed with the texlive@@VERSION@@-exec
  package, but if you are on an architecture supported by tlmgr and want
  things to work like before, the tlmgr provided binaries can be
  installed as well with:

  # tlmgr platform add [x86_64|i386|armel|armhf|powerpc]-linux
  # tlmgr platform set [x86_64|i386|armel|armhf|powerpc]-linux

  This change can also be undone later with:

  # tlmgr platform set custom
  # tlmgr platform remove [x86_64|i386|armel|armhf|powerpc]-linux

  Your path should be updated automatically on session reload from
  /etc/profile.d/texlive.sh

- By default the basic scheme is installed. You can easily install the
  other schemes with tlmgr, as collection-small, collection-medium and
  collection-full, respectively.

- See http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html for installation
  details. The location of TeX Live binaries is set in the file:

  /etc/profile.d/texlive.sh

  It is set by xbps-alternatives. If you want to use another installed
  version, do not overwrite the file, but use xbps-alternatives. Verify
  if it is set correctly with:

  $ env | grep ^PATH

- TeX Live is free software, see the files:

  /usr/share/licenses/@@PKGNAME@@/LICENSE.TL
  /usr/share/licenses/@@PKGNAME@@/LICENSE.CTAN

- To update or install packages for your TeX Live installation, use:

  /opt/texlive/@@VERSION@@/bin/@@ARCH@@/tlmgr

  For details and documentation, see:

  http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#EXAMPLES

- WARNING: To avoid messing up your TeX Live installation, DON'T use
  the installation scripts in /opt/texlive@@VERSION@@-installer
